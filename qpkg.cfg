QPKG_SUMMARY="QMaven is a QPKG wrapper around Apache Maven. Maven 3.3+ requires JDK 1.7 or above to execute but they still allow you to build against 1.3 or other versions by using the supplied toolchain."

# Preferred number in start/stop sequence. The value is ignored after a reboot and the number is assigned depending on the order of the applications in '/etc/config/qpkg.conf', starting with 100. If so, it's pretty useless.

# Use absolute or relative paths (to $SYS_QPKG_DIR) to specify files that:
# - Are always replaced when upgrading the package, unless both versions are identical.
# - Will be saved (file.qdksave) before being replaced when upgrading the package, unless both versions are identical.
# - Will be saved (file.qdkorig) before being replaced when upgrading the package and the original version was not marked as a configuration file.
# Multiple definitions are allowed. Automatically generated configuration files (e.g. during installation) can also be specified but it is necessary to use the '--force-config' option or set 'QDK_FORCE_CONFIG' to 'TRUE'.
# Looks to be pretty useless too when compared to moving the config files to a safe place (e.g. '/etc/config').
